What is an LSTM?

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, designed to address the vanishing gradient problem that can occur in traditional RNNs. RNNs are a class of artificial neural networks where connections between units can create cycles, allowing them to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior. They are particularly well-suited for tasks involving sequences, such as time series prediction, speech recognition, and natural language processing.


In this notebook I explore:
1. The components of an LSTM.
2. The math behind each of the gates and their activation functions.
3. Using a LSTM for a stock predictor. 

Learning about LSTMs was a fun addition to my education portfolio.
